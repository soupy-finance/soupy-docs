The Soupy litepaper is now [officially published](/litepaper), on schedule with the timeline! It contains all of the details regarding what we have planned for Soupy in the coming months and our long-term vision for the project. If you've been itching for a powerful, fully featured, and decentralized exchange, we think this litepaper will get you excited for what's to come. This is also the first announcement of our novel USDI stablecoin that will be fully backed and decentralized while offering legtimiate yields and inflation resistance.
