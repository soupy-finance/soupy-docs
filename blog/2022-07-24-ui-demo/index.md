The Soupy trading UI devnet demo is now [officially live](https://soupy.finance/trade)! It features the very first look at the design and functionality of Soupy's trading interface, with everything running entirely within a simulated blockchain (the devnet). The live prices you see on the homepage and in the UI come directly from a chain validator acting as an oracle, and all trades are executed within the on-chain order book and have latencies resembling those of the future mainnet. Please note there are still some bugs and not all features are implemented yet, namely the archival server that provides order history and persistent trade history. We will continue to update and develop the UI and blockchain in preparation for the testnet launch this quarter, with the goal of having full spot trading features, simple swaps, and oAMM liquidity complete by the end of the quarter. The SOUP token ICO will also be coming this quarter, so keep an eye out for more new coming soon.
